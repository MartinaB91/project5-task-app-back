## Solved bugs during development
- [#58](https://github.com/MartinaB91/project5-task-app-front/issues/58) Family member images won't show

## Validation 
### Python 

To validate the python code the extension "pycodestyle" has been used. 

GitPod PROBLEMS reports following errors when 'objects' is used "Class 'MODEL' has no 'objects' member" and "Class 'MODEL' has no 'DoesNotExist' member", this is an error that is safe to ignore according to Google and student channel. 

The validation of the settings.py has been only checked for errors and severe warnings. All other error/warnings/information has been left as is because changes in the settings file could affect the whole project.
